Assumption #1: All processes are in a group. 
If not all processes are in a group, then they cannot exclusively access the shared 
resourse. That is, if a process is in a group by itself, it will access the shared
resource regardless of the other nodes in the system.

Assumption #2: All groups have a non-empty intersection.
Similarly, to a violation of Assumption #1, if all groups do not have a non-zero 
intersection then groups cannot exclusively access the share resource. That is, 
if groups are disjoint, they will access the shared resource regardless of the 
other groups in the system.

Assumption #3: All groups are the same size.
If this assumption is voilated, it is not catastrophic, but will only cause some
inefficiencies in the number of messages passed between groups.

Assumption #4: Each process is contained in the same number of voting sets.
If this assumption is voilated, it is not catastrophic, but will only cause some
inefficiencies in the number of messages passed between groups.
